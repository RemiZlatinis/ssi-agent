# name: API Health
# description: Checks the health of an API that has a health check endpoint
# version: 1.0
# schedule: *:0/01:00
# timeout: 10

# --- Description ---
# The following script calls the health check endpoint at the configured URL
# and checks for the expected response.
# Returns "OK" "API is healthy" if all checks are fine.
# Returns "WARNING" "Health check failed" if any check fails or the request fails.
# Returns "FAILURE" "API is unreachable" if the api is unreachable.

# --- Constants ---
STATUS_OK="OK"
STATUS_UPDATE="UPDATE"
STATUS_WARNING="WARNING"
STATUS_FAILURE="FAILURE"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# --- Configuration ---
URL="https://api.service-status-indicator.com/api/health/"
read -r -d '' EXPECTED_RESPONSE << 'EOF'

 "DatabaseBackend": "working",
 "DatabaseBackend[default]": "working",

# Fetch HTTP status first to check reachability
